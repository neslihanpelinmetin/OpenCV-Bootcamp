# OpenCV-Bootcamp - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning journey through the **OpenCV Bootcamp**! This course is helping me gain a solid understanding of Computer Vision using **OpenCV** and Python. In this repository, I’ll share my experiences, insights, and projects as I progress through the course.

## 📌 Course Overview

- **Course Code:** OCVBC
- **Type:** Preparatory
- **Language:** Python
- **Format:** Videos, Quizzes, and Colab Notebooks
- **Certification:** Official OpenCV Certification upon completion

## 🚀 My Progress
This bootcamp consists of **14 modules**, covering fundamental to advanced topics in OpenCV. Below is my current progress and experiences:

| Status    | Module Number | Module Name | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| ✅ | 1 | Getting Started With Images | Learning how to load, display, and save images using OpenCV. Exploring different image formats, how OpenCV reads images, and how to visualize them using Matplotlib. |
| ✅ | 2 | Basic Image Manipulation | Practicing resizing, rotating, cropping, and enhancing images. |
| ✅ | 3 | Histograms and Color Segmentation | Understanding image histograms and performing color-based segmentation. |
| ⏳ | 4 | Video Processing and Analysis | Working with video streams and real-time processing. |
| ❌ | 5 | Contour and Shape Analysis | Detecting and analyzing object shapes. |
| ❌ | 6 | Playing Games Using CV (HCI) | Implementing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) techniques in mini-projects. |
| ❌ | 7 | Building and Deploying Web Apps with Streamlit | Creating interactive CV applications. |
| ❌ | 8 | Image Registration Techniques | Exploring feature-based and intensity-based image alignment. |
| ❌ | 9 | ArUco Markers for Augmented Reality | Experimenting with ArUco markers for AR applications. |
| ❌ | 10 | Deep Learning with OpenCV | Implementing deep learning models using OpenCV. |
| ❌ | 11 | Face and Landmark Detection | Building face detection and facial landmark detection models. |

## 📂 My Course Resources
- **Google Colab Notebooks** – My hands-on coding exercises and notes.
- **Quizzes & Challenges** – Insights from quizzes and challenges I completed.
- **Projects** – Small projects I will build during the course.

## 🎓 My Certification Goal
After completing the course, I aim to receive the **Official OpenCV Certification**, which will be a valuable addition to my portfolio!

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of **Python**.
- Familiarity with **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.
- A working environment with **OpenCV installed** (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or local setup).

## 🔗 My Reflections
So far, the **Getting Started With Images** module was a great introduction to OpenCV. I enjoyed working with different image formats and understanding how OpenCV processes image data. I'm excited to continue learning and applying these skills in real-world applications.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
