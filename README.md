# OpenCV-Bootcamp - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning journey through the **OpenCV Bootcamp**! This course is helping me gain a solid understanding of Computer Vision using **OpenCV** and Python. In this repository, I’ll share my experiences, insights, and projects as I progress through the course.

## 📌 Course Overview

- **Course Code:** OCVBC
- **Type:** Preparatory
- **Language:** Python
- **Format:** Videos, Quizzes, and Colab Notebooks
- **Certification:** Official OpenCV Certification upon completion

## 🚀 My Progress
This bootcamp consists of **14 modules**, covering fundamental to advanced topics in OpenCV. Below is my current progress and experiences:

| Status | Module Number | Module Name                     | Description |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| ✅     | 1              | Getting Started With Images      | Learn how to load, display, and save images using OpenCV. Explore different image formats, how OpenCV reads images, and how to visualize them using Matplotlib. |
| ✅     | 2              | Basic Image Manipulation         | Practice resizing, rotating, cropping, and enhancing images. |
| ✅     | 3              | Image Annotation                 | Draw shapes, write text, and add labels or markers to images using OpenCV’s annotation functions. |
| ✅     | 4              | Image Enhancement                | Improve image quality through contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and denoising techniques. |
| ✅     | 5              | Accessing the Camera             | Capture live video streams from a camera, display them in real-time, and save frames. |
| ✅     | 6              | Video Writing                    | Record video from a camera or a sequence of frames and save it to a file using different codecs. |
| ✅     | 7              | Image Filtering                  | Apply various filters like Gaussian, median, and bilateral for blurring and noise reduction. |
| ✅     | 8              | Image Features and Alignment     | Detect keypoints using SIFT, SURF, ORB, and align images using feature matching. |
| ✅     | 9              | Panorama                         | Stitch multiple images together to create panoramic views. |
| ✅     | 10             | HDR                              | Create High Dynamic Range (HDR) images by combining multiple exposures of the same scene. |
| ✅     | 11             | Object Tracking                  | Track moving objects in videos using algorithms like Meanshift, Camshift, and optical flow. |
| ✅     | 12             | Face Detection                   | Detect faces in images and video using Haar cascades and other pre-trained models. |
| ✅     | 13             | Tensorflow Object Detection      | Use TensorFlow’s object detection API to detect and classify objects in images and video. |
| ✅     | 14             | Pose Estimation using OpenPose   | Estimate human poses by detecting key body joints with OpenPose or similar deep learning models. |

## 📂 My Course Resources
- **Google Colab Notebooks** – My hands-on coding exercises and notes.
- **Quizzes & Challenges** – Insights from quizzes and challenges I completed.
- **Projects** – Small projects I will build during the course.

## 🎓 My Certification Goal
After completing the course, I aim to receive the **Official OpenCV Certification**, which will be a valuable addition to my portfolio!

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of **Python**.
- Familiarity with **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.
- A working environment with **OpenCV installed** (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or local setup).

## 🔗 My Reflections
So far, the **Getting Started With Images** module was a great introduction to OpenCV. I enjoyed working with different image formats and understanding how OpenCV processes image data. I'm excited to continue learning and applying these skills in real-world applications.

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
